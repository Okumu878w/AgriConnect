AgriConnect (Django)



> **Bridging the gap between farm and fork with Python.**

AgriConnect is a dual-interface digital marketplace built with **Django** designed to eliminate supply chain inefficiencies by connecting agricultural producers directly with consumers. By leveraging Django's robust backend and secure authentication, we empower farmers in regions like Riftvalley to list produce directly, while ensuring buyers receive fresh, organic products with full transparency.



 Problem Statement

The current agricultural supply chain faces significant challenges:
1.  **Low Farmer Margins:** Reliance on middlemen reduces the profit for producers.
2.  **Inflated Consumer Prices:** Markups make basic goods expensive for buyers.
3.  **Lack of Transparency:** Buyers lack data on the origin and harvest date of their food.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

AgriConnect solves these issues via a centralized Django web platform:
* **Direct Market Access:** Farmers sell globally or locally without intermediaries.
* **Smart Dashboard:** A view for farmers to track sales and inventory (visualized with Chart.js).
* **Trust & Transparency:** "Story of the Food" feature displaying origin details.
